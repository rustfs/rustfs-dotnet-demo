# RustFS .NET S3 Demo Project

<p align="center"> English |  <a href="https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs-dotnet-demo/blob/main/README-CN.md">ä¸­æ–‡</a> </p>
This is a .NET S3 demo project implemented using RustFS technology, demonstrating how to interact with S3-compatible storage services in a .NET environment.

## Feature Overview

This project mainly implements the following functions:
- Bucket Management: Create, delete, check existence, and list all buckets
- File Management: Upload, download, delete, and list files within a bucket
- Unified API response format `ApiResponse`
- Exception handling middleware

## Key Features

- Perform object storage operations using AWS S3-compatible APIs
- Clear error handling and response format
- Modular code structure
- Support for asynchronous operations

## API Specifications

All APIs follow a unified response format containing the following fields:
- Success: Whether the operation was successful
- Code: HTTP status code
- Message: Description of the operation result
- Data: Returned data (if any)


## Environmental Description

- Install `NET9 SDK 9.0.7Â·` and the latest version, command to view environment information:

```bash
dotnet --info
```

- Install the `Docker` environment locally and start the `RustFS` container service:

```bash
# Pull image
docker pull rustfs/rustfs:latest
# Start container
docker run -d \
  --name rustfs \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  -v /data:/data \
  rustfs/rustfs:latest
```

## Example usage

### Start project

- Use the ` cmd/powershell/pwsh ` terminal to run the following command:

```pwsh
# Clone project
git clone  https://gitee.com/dolayout/rustfs_dotnet.git
# Enter the root directory of the project
cd rustfs_dotnet
# Restore Nuget package
dotnet restore
# Run the project
dotnet run -c Release -p ./src/rustfs_dotnet_s3_demo
```

- Browser input address:

```bash
http://localhost:5073/scalar/v1
```

### Interface operation

- Create a Bucket

```http
POST /api/bucket/{bucketName}
```

- Upload a File

```http
POST /api/file/upload/{bucketName}/{key}
Form-data: file=@local_file_path
```

- Download a File

```http
GET /api/file/download/{bucketName}/{key}
```

- Delete a File

```http
DELETE /api/file/{bucketName}/{key}
```

## Project Structure

- Controllers: Contains controller classes such as BucketManageController.cs and FileManageController.cs
- Extensions: Contains controller extension methods
- Handlers: Contains classes related to exception handling
- Models: Contains response model classes
- Services: Contains AWS S3 service implementation
- Settings: Contains AWS S3 configuration settings

## Error Handling

The project uses a unified exception handling mechanism. All exceptions will be converted into ProblemDetailsResponse format before being returned to the client.

## Configuration

AWS S3 connection information is configured through the AwsS3Setting class, which includes service URL, access key, secret key, and region settings.
